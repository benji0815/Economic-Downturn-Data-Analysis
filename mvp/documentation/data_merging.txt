Merge the following:

All data will be munged to exclude any data before 1985.

1. Corp_Bond_AAA, Corp_Bond_BBB, Corp_Bond_B, and then US_Yield_Curve
	- Using 5-year data

2. S&P_500_div_yield_month and US_Yield_Curve (10-year data)
	
	Part 1:
	- Merge S&P_500_div_yield by month and US_Yield_Curve by month
		- This part will compare monthly data points
	
	Part 2:
	- Merge S&P_500_1M_Futures (daily) with S&P_500_div_yield (monthly)
		- Calculate the $ dividend yield per month and apply to calculating the S&P daily futures
			- Goal is to calculate each day's dividend yield % instead of just the month end.
	- Then merge daily calculated rates with the daily US_Yield_Curve


3. Gold1MFutures and Copper1MFutures
	- Merging the two data frames and adding S&P_500_1M_Futures as an overlay



Individual Data Sets for Overlays:

1. S&P_500_1M_Futures

2. S&P_500_PE_ratio_month



*** S&P_500_1M_Futures will be primary overlay for comparison and analysis ***
